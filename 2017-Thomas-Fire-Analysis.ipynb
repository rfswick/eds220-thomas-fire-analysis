    "The 2017 Thomas Fire burned 281,893 acres of Santa Barbara and Ventura county, destroyed 1,063 structures, and resulted in the deaths of 1 civilian and 1 firefighter. The fire had far reaching impacts on the surrounding communities both during and after the fire eventually burned out. This analysis shows how python can be used to visualize the burn scar caused by the fire, and demonstrate how air quality was affected before, during, and after the fire. \n",
